# Y/Labs — Developer Guide

> **Live site:** [yalelabs.io](https://yalelabs.io/) · **Beta:** [ylabs-dev.onrender.com](https://ylabs-dev.onrender.com)

---

## What Is This?

Y/Labs is a **Yale research lab discovery platform**. Visitors can browse public research listings with supporting evidence/source metadata, students find labs and fellowships, professors create and manage listings, and admins oversee everything.

---

## Architecture

```
React (Vite) → Express (Passport.js) → MongoDB Atlas + Meilisearch
                    ↓
            External APIs: Yale CAS, Yalies, Yale Directory, CourseTable, OpenAI (via Meilisearch), Sentry
```

The server follows: **Routes → Middleware → Controllers → Services → Models**

### Tech Stack

| Layer           | Technology                                                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client          | React 19, TypeScript, Vite 6, React Router v6, MUI v7, styled-components, TailwindCSS v3 |
| Server          | Express 4, TypeScript, Passport.js (CAS strategy), Mongoose 8                            |
| Search          | Meilisearch (hybrid search: keyword + semantic via OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`)      |
| Database        | MongoDB Atlas (single cluster, separate databases per environment)                       |
| Error Tracking  | Sentry for client and server runtime exception reporting                                 |
| Package Manager | Yarn 4 via Corepack                                                                      |

## Environments

Code flows **Local → Beta → Prod**. Beta is the staging gate.

| Environment | Hosting            | MongoDB Database | Meilisearch                   | `MEILISEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX`  |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Local       | localhost          | `Development`    | Docker (`localhost:7700`)     | _(unset)_ → bare `listings` |
| Beta        | Render (free tier) | `Beta`           | Shared Render private service | `beta` → `beta_listings`    |
| Prod        | Render (starter)   | `Production`     | Shared Render private service | `prod` → `prod_listings`    |

- MongoDB: one Atlas cluster, three databases. `MONGODBURL` points to the right one per environment.
- Meilisearch: beta and prod share one Render private service, isolated by index prefixes. Local uses its own Docker container.

---

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 20.9.0
- Corepack (ships with Node ≥ 16.9)
- Docker Desktop (for local Meilisearch)

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
corepack enable
yarn install:all
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy the example and fill in credentials:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Your local `.env` should point to:

- `MONGODBURL` → the `Development` database on Atlas
- `MEILISEARCH_HOST` → `http://localhost:7700`
- `MEILISEARCH_API_KEY` → your local master key (e.g., `testkey`)
- No `MEILISEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX` (local uses bare `listings` index)
- Leave `SENTRY_DSN` unset unless you want to test server-side error reporting locally

For the client:

```bash
# client/.env
VITE_APP_SERVER=http://localhost:4000
# Optional: VITE_SENTRY_DSN=...
```

### 3. Start local Meilisearch

Pull the latest Meilisearch image and start a container:

```bash
docker pull getmeili/meilisearch:latest
docker run -d -p 7700:7700 \
  -e MEILI_MASTER_KEY=testkey \
  -v meili_data:/meili_data \
  getmeili/meilisearch:latest
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:7700/health
# Should return: {"status":"available"}
```

Data persists in the `meili_data` volume — you only need to seed once.

### 4. Seed Meilisearch

```bash
cd data-migration
npx ts-node --transpile-only MigrateToMeilisearch.ts
```

This reads listings from your `Development` MongoDB and pushes them to the local Meilisearch with the OpenAI embedder configured. Listing evidence is indexed with public-safe source metadata only; `evidence.internalNotes` is stripped before documents are sent to Meilisearch.

### 5. Start dev servers

```bash
yarn dev:client    # Vite on port 3000
yarn dev:server    # Express with nodemon on port 4000
```

### Dev login bypass

Visit `http://localhost:4000/api/dev-login` to log in as a test user (`test123` / `student`) without CAS.

If the client cannot reach the auth endpoint, `/login` shows an inline retry state and hides the Yale CAS sign-in link until the auth check succeeds.

## Search

Search uses **Meilisearch** with keyword search and hybrid mode (80% semantic, 20% keyword) for multi-word queries.

1. Client sends query + filters to `/api/listings/search`
2. Controller builds Meilisearch filter strings from query params
3. Multi-word queries use hybrid search with the Meilisearch-configured OpenAI embedder; single-word queries use keyword search to avoid semantic drift
4. If hybrid search fails, the controller retries keyword-only Meilisearch; if Meilisearch is unavailable, it falls back to MongoDB filtering
5. Results are returned with `totalCount` for pagination and a `degraded` boolean indicating whether fallback behavior was used

Logged-out visitors use the public research discovery path instead:

- Client routes `/research` and `/research/:slug` render the listings browse page without the `PrivateRoute` guard.
- The client mirrors public research search state into shareable URLs and restores it on page load and browser back/forward navigation. URL-backed state includes `query`, `departments`, `academicDisciplines`, `researchAreas`, the three `*Mode` filter operators, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`, and the client-only `quickFilter`.
- Opening a public card preserves the current search params on `/research/:slug`; closing the modal returns to `/research` with the same params.
- The client sends public browse requests to `/api/research` and public detail requests to `/api/research/:slug`.
- Public responses include only confirmed, unarchived listings and redact contact/private fields such as owner email, additional emails, owner/professor IDs, view counts, favorites, and audit fields. They retain sanitized evidence metadata so the detail modal can show why a listing appears and which public sources support it.
- Authenticated users opening a public detail modal also request `/api/research/:slug/contact` to load the full listing, including contact fields. Evidence metadata on this response is still sanitized through the public evidence allowlist.
- Public research search only allows `createdAt` and `updatedAt` sort fields and searches a contact-redacted field set.

Listing detail modals render an evidence rail for listings, including an empty state when source metadata is unavailable. The public evidence payload supports `status`, `summary`, `confidence`, `generatedAt`, `lastVerifiedAt`, and up to eight sources with `label`, `url`, `sourceType`, `description`, and `lastCheckedAt`. Loading and error states are handled in the same rail. Public source URLs are limited to `http`/`https`; credentials, query strings, and fragments are removed before they are returned by the API or rendered by the client.

Listing CRUD in `listingService.ts` automatically syncs to Meilisearch after MongoDB writes. Indexed listing documents strip `_id`, `__v`, legacy `embedding`, and private `evidence.internalNotes` fields.

On the authenticated Find Labs page, an empty unfiltered result set is treated as "no research labs are available right now" and includes a link to `/fellowships`; empty filtered/search results instead tell the user no labs match the current search or filters.

The Meilisearch client (`server/src/utils/meiliClient.ts`) exports:

- `getMeiliClient()` — lazy-loaded singleton
- `getMeiliIndex(name)` — returns a prefixed index (e.g., `prod_listings`)
- `resolveIndexName(name)` — pure function for prefix resolution

---

## Authentication

```
User → Yale CAS SSO → passport.ts findOrCreateUser
     → Check DB (refresh if stale >30 days)
     → Yalies API (student/grad detection)
     → Yale Directory (faculty detection)
     → Fallback: userType "unknown"
     → Create/Update User → cookie-session
```

Client auth state is owned by `UserContextProvider` and `userReducer`. Failed auth refreshes set `authError` for inline UI, clear loading, and preserve any previously authenticated user so a transient outage does not blank the session; retrying `checkContext()` clears the stale error while the next auth check runs.

### Auth Middleware (`server/src/middleware/auth.ts`)

| Middleware         | Check                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `isAuthenticated`  | `req.user` exists                                     |
| `isAdmin`          | `userType === 'admin'`                                |
| `isProfessor`      | `userType` in `['professor', 'faculty', 'admin']`     |
| `canCreateListing` | professor/faculty + `profileVerified` (admins bypass) |

---

## Error Handling

The client root is wrapped in `ErrorBoundary`, which shows a recovery screen for unexpected render errors and reports them through `client/src/utils/errorTracking.ts` when `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is configured.

The server initializes Sentry from `server/src/utils/errorTracking.ts` during startup when `SENTRY_DSN` is configured. Startup failures and 500-level errors handled by `server/src/middleware/errorHandler.ts` are captured with environment and release tags when provided.

---

## Analytics

Listing events are logged through route-level response interception in `server/src/routes/listings.ts`. Public research contact events are logged from the contact controller paths: contact detail reveal, email click attempts, and reported outreach outcomes. The admin analytics dashboard includes an Outreach Loop section with reveal/click/outcome totals, outcome breakdowns, top contacted listings, and recent outreach events.

Outreach analytics intentionally avoid raw private contact data. Metadata is limited to channel, source, contact count, action, and the selected outcome.

---

## API Routes

All mount under `/api`.

| Prefix            | Description                                                  | Auth                                             |

## Testing

Client-side tests run under **Vitest 3** with a `jsdom` environment. Configuration lives in the `test` block of [client/vite.config.js](client/vite.config.js), and [client/src/setupTests.ts](client/src/setupTests.ts) loads shared Testing Library matchers. The server uses Vitest for focused middleware and utility tests, plus a focused Node test script for listing-search degradation, but no general server-side test suite is wired into CI.

### Running tests

```bash
cd client
yarn test        # watch mode — reruns on file changes
yarn test:ci     # single run — used by CI

cd ../server
yarn test                 # focused middleware and utility coverage
yarn test:search-degrade  # listing-search fallback coverage
```

Client tests are discovered from `client/src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}`. Server Vitest coverage currently includes error handling and error tracking utilities.

### What is tested

Pure reducer modules under [client/src/reducers/](client/src/reducers/) have unit-test coverage in [client/src/reducers/**tests**/](client/src/reducers/__tests__/). Each reducer file has a matching `*.test.ts`. The reducers back the auth, search, fellowship-search, config, listing-form, and account-tracking (kanban/notes) flows — extracting state transitions from providers/components into pure functions makes them testable without mounting React or mocking network.

When adding a new reducer:

1. Place the reducer in [client/src/reducers/](client/src/reducers/) with an exported `createInitial<Name>State()` factory.
2. Add `client/src/reducers/__tests__/<name>.test.ts` covering each action type, the initial state, and a purity check (reducer does not mutate prior state).
3. Import the reducer in the provider/component via `useReducer`; keep side effects (network, localStorage, timers) in the component, not the reducer.

### CI

Pull requests into `main` or `beta` trigger [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml), which runs:

1. `yarn install:all`
2. `yarn --cwd client test:ci`
3. `yarn build` (server + client)

The workflow also accepts `workflow_dispatch` so it can be run manually from the Actions tab. Branch protection (configured in GitHub repo settings → Branches) requires this check to pass before merging.

`tsc --noEmit` is **not** part of CI yet — the client has known pre-existing type errors that need a cleanup pass before strict type-checking can be enforced.

---

## Adding Things

### New API Endpoint

1. Route in `server/src/routes/<resource>.ts`
2. Controller in `server/src/controllers/<resource>Controller.ts`
3. Service in `server/src/services/<resource>Service.ts`
4. Apply auth/validation middleware in the route

### New Page

1. Page component in `client/src/pages/<page>.tsx`
2. Route in `client/src/App.tsx` with appropriate guard (`PrivateRoute`, `AdminRoute`)

Public pages that should work for logged-out visitors must not use `PrivateRoute`; protected actions from those pages should route users to `/login` and preserve the return path.

### Modifying a Schema

1. Mongoose schema in `server/src/models/<model>.ts`
2. TypeScript interfaces in `client/src/types/`
3. Migration script in `data-migration/` if existing data needs transformation
4. If the model is `listing`, update Meilisearch index config if new fields need filtering/sorting

Listing evidence metadata lives under `listing.evidence` in MongoDB. Keep any analyst-only notes in `evidence.internalNotes`; that field is excluded by default from Mongoose query results, stripped from Meilisearch indexing, and never returned by public research endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                           | Solution                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CAS login not working locally   | Use dev-login: `http://localhost:4000/api/dev-login`                        |
| Find Labs has no local results  | Seed Development listings or use the empty-state link to browse fellowships |
| Search is degraded or stale     | Check Meilisearch is running: `curl http://localhost:7700/health`           |
| Meilisearch connection refused  | Start Docker container or check `MEILISEARCH_HOST` in `.env`                |
| CORS errors                     | Add origin to `allowList` in `app.ts` or use dev mode                       |
| "Forbidden" on listing creation | Professor needs `profileVerified: true`                                     |
